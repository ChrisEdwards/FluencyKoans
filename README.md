Fluency Koans
===============

The Fluency Koans are a set of code-based exercises that will guide you into learning Fluency. You complete one exercise at a time. Each koan builds up your knowledge of Fluency and builds upon itself. 

Each koan is a unit test that you need to make pass. Read the instructions in the comments, and complete the koan by replacing the __ variable/method in the code with your implementation. When your code makes the test pass, you are ready to move on to the next koan.

Start by opening the FluencyKoans solution and then open the FluencyKoans.cs file in the Koans folder.
